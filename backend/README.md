# Backend - DO NOT MODIFY IF YOUR WORKING ON FRONTEND

⚠️ **This folder contains backend infrastructure code.**

## What's here?

- `signaling.js` - WebSocket signaling server for WebRTC connections

## Why shouldn't I touch this?

This code handles the low-level WebRTC signaling between the phone (camera source) and laptop (viewer). It's working correctly and doesn't need UI changes.

## If something breaks

Contact the backend developer (Harrison) before making any changes here.
